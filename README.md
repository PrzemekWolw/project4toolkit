# Project4 Toolkit

## Features

This toolkit is a reverse engineering tool for the exportation of file formats used in the RAGE Engine Grand Theft Auto Games.

This includes formats for models, meshes, and world placement conversion to more commonplace file formats, including .obj and .dae.

It also supports the direct conversion of locally stored assets to 2 currently supported game packages: BeamNG.Drive and Assetto Corsa.

It supports proper material mapping for modifications to be done in blender or .3DS MAX, and supports native positional and quaternion rotations normally applied to models during engine runtime. 

## Games Supported
Grand Theft Auto IV (.wpl, .wdr, .wdb)

Grand Theft Auto V (.ymap, .ydr, .ydb)

## Support Planned
Blender GUI support for reading, writing, and repacking to native formats.

Collision model exportation.

Multiple .wpl instance duplication support for .wdrs.
